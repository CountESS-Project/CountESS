# Getting Started with CountESS

CountESS is more like a toolbox than a single program: it can do all 
sorts of things, but that makes it a little tricky to work out how
to get started.  This tutorial attempts to walk you through a simple 
task to demonstrate how to solve simple bioinformatics tasks with
CountESS.

## Demo Files

The [countess-demo](https://github.com/CountESS-Project/countess-demo/)
project provides a collection of demonstration files for use in these examples.
You can download a ZIP of the files [here](https://github.com/CountESS-Project/countess-demo/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

Demo files consist of randomly generated data.
Any resemblance to organisms living or otherwise is coincidental.

## Example 1: Reading & Counting Sequences

`countess_gui example1.ini`

This example shows just about the simplest CountESS
pipeline.


## Example 2: Translating Barcodes


## Example 3: Calling Variants
